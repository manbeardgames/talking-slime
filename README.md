# Talking Slime
This is a small demo project that I use on my [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/manbeardgames) to animate the talking of a 2D slime sprite for my on stream avatar.

You can see it in action [in this Tweet](https://twitter.com/manbeardgames/status/1354526488629047298)

## Usage
The code for the application resides in the **TalkingSlime.cs** file.  At the top of the class are serval fields that have been marked as the ones that can be adjusted to suite your needs.

* `_microphoneName`:  This is the name of your microphone listening device to use for detecting audio input.  It can be a partial word.  
* `_micDeviceID`:  This is the device ID of your microphone.  You can find this value by running this game once within visual studio then checking the Output panel window which will show all detected input devices and their ids.  
* `_closeThreshold`: This is a float value between 0.0f and 100.0f.  This value determines at which point in the microphone levels it is determined that the microphone is closed.  To find your appropriate level, run the game and look at the window title bar to see the current levels and choose based on that information.  
* `_openThreshold`:  This is a float value between 0.0f and 100.0f.  This value determines at which point in the microphone's levels it is determined that the microphone is open.  To find your appropriate level, run the game and look at the window title bar to see the current levels and choose based on that information.  
* `_defaultScale`:  This is the default x and y axis scale value to use when rendering the mouth. This value is used when the microphone is in a "closed" state.  
* `_scaleMin`: This is the minimum x and y axis scale value to use when rendering the mouth only during the microphone "open" state.  
* `_scaleMax`:  This is the maximum x and y axis scale value to use when rendering the mouth only during the microphone "open" state.
